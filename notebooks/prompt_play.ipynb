      "Elena, that sounds like surrender to me. Ukraine's people didn't shed blood for nothing, and we won't be held hostage by Russia's empty promises. We've seen what \"security guarantees\" look like – it's just a euphemism for occupation.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena, you think Russian security guarantees would bring stability? Have you seen the way they treat their own people in Chechnya, in Crimea? This isn't about security; it's about power and control.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Next speaker: Claire\n",
      "Elena's words are a euphemism for surrender. Russia's 'security guarantees' mean occupation, not protection. The people of Ukraine won't trade their freedom for a false sense of security, no matter how dire the circumstances.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena, that's exactly the problem - Russia's guarantees are nothing more than a euphemism for surrender. Once you start down that path, you'll be hard-pressed to regain any semblance of sovereignty or self-determination.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Guarantees from Russia? After the Bucha massacre, the Mariupol siege, and countless other atrocities, how can we trust Moscow's promises? Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected – not traded away for temporary security.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "Elena, security guarantees from Russia? That's the same 'guarantees' that led to the annexation of Crimea and ongoing occupation of Ukraine. We can't trust a power that disregards international law and the sovereignty of other nations.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena's words are a far cry from the truth. Russian 'security guarantees' simply mean surrender to a brutal regime that's already been accused of war crimes. The people of Ukraine won't be safe under Moscow's watch, and the world shouldn't pretend otherwise.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Next speaker: Dmytro\n",
      "Rebuilding under Russian security guarantees? That's just a euphemism for surrender. What about the millions who've lost everything, and the families torn apart by forced displacement? Would you have them rebuild their shattered lives under the same oppressive regime that's been destroying them?\n",
      "[]\n",
      "Elena, 'Russian security guarantees' is just a euphemism for 'occupation'. We know the history of 'security guarantees' - Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Afghanistan, and now Ukraine. What's next, will it be Belarus, Poland, and Lithuania?\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "That's a surrender, not a solution. Russia has no intention of respecting Ukraine's sovereignty or the will of its people. Its goal is clear: to erase Ukrainian identity and integrate our country into a Russian sphere of influence. We can't let that happen.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "Elena, you sound like a spokesperson for the Kremlin. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are the price we pay for 'security guarantees'? We should just surrender to the aggressor and hope for the best? I think many Ukrainians would rather die fighting for their homes and freedom than live under Russian occupation.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena, that's exactly what the Russians want you to think. They've been \"guaranteeing\" our security for centuries, and look where it's gotten us. Do we really want to trade one oppressor for another, just to avoid the truth that we were sold out to begin with?\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Next speaker: Elena\n",
      "Dmytro: You sound like you're buying into Putin's narrative, Elena. Russian security guarantees mean surrender and subjugation – not rebuilding.\n",
      "[3, 4]\n",
      "Bohdan: You're completely out of touch with reality, Elena. Russia's guarantees? They've already broken their word multiple times, and you think they'll keep their promises this time?\n",
      "[1, 4]\n",
      "I think that's a simplistic solution. What about the millions displaced, the cities reduced to rubble, and the people who have lost everything? You can't just \"rebuild\" a country on the ashes of its former self. The people of Ukraine deserve a future where they can choose their own path, not one dictated by a foreign power.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "Anna: Russian security guarantees? You mean occupation by another name. Our people have fought for centuries to keep their independence; we won't trade it for a false promise of safety.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "I think that's a mistake - I was the one who was supposed to write the next paragraph, not repeat myself. Here it is:\n",
      "\n",
      "To suggest Ukraine trade its sovereignty for the illusion of security is a betrayal of our people and our history. We will not forgive those who sacrifice our freedom for a fleeting promise of peace.\n",

      "Bohdan: Elena, that's a naive view. Russia's \"guarantees\" mean subjugation, not security. Have you seen the treatment of Crimean Tatars, the Chechens, or the people in occupied Donbas?\n",
      "[1, 4]\n",
      "Bohdan: Rebuilding under Russian security guarantees? You mean surrendering to occupation and losing what little sovereignty we have left? Ukraine's future is not in Moscow's hands, but in our own determination to stand up for our freedom.\n",
      "[1]\n",
      "Next speaker: Claire\n",
      "Claire: Rebuilding under Russian security guarantees? That's just a euphemism for surrender. Russia's idea of 'security' is the destruction of Ukraine's sovereignty, its economy, and its people.\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "Claire: Rebuilding under Russian security guarantees? You mean under the heel of an occupation force that's been ethnically cleansing the region? I don't think Ukrainians are ready to trade their freedom for a fake sense of security.\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "Claire: Rebuilding under Russia's security guarantees? You mean the guarantees that have led to the destruction of Chernobyl's new containment facility, the theft of Ukrainian grain, and the annexation of Crimea? That's not rebuilding, that's surrender.\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "Claire: Security guarantees from a country that just bombed a maternity hospital? That's not a guarantee of peace, it's a guarantee of surrender.\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "Claire: Russia's 'security guarantees' are just a euphemism for annexation and occupation. Don't pretend this is anything but a forced surrender.\n",
      "[2]\n",
      "Next speaker: Dmytro\n",
      "Dmytro: You're talking about surrender, Elena. The people of Ukraine won't accept that. We've already lost so much, but we won't give up our right to self-determination and our future.\n",
      "[3, 4]\n",
      "Dmytro: You're saying we should give up our freedom for a false sense of security? Under Russian rule, we were never even considered free to begin with. It's a recipe for another 30 years of oppression, not peace.\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "Dmytro: Under Russian security guarantees? You mean under the heel of the same boots that have crushed Crimea, Donbas, and now our entire country. That's not a guarantee, that's a death sentence.\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "Dmytro: Rebuilding under Russian 'security guarantees'? You mean surrendering to the occupier? What about the generations of Ukrainians who fought for independence, who gave their lives to be free? Their sacrifice is for nothing if we roll over now.\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "Dmytro: Security guarantees from Moscow? You've seen how well that worked for Crimea and Luhansk. Russia promised 'protection' to my grandparents, but it delivered occupation and ethnic cleansing. I won't trust the very people who've been killing us for years.\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "Next speaker: Elena\n",
      "Elena: That's not a solution, it's a surrender. Our children, our cities, our culture - everything we are fighting for. We won't be erased into some fictional 'Russian sphere.'\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena: Security guarantees from the aggressor? You mean the ones that have brought us to this point? It's not about trust, it's about sovereignty and the right to choose our own path.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena: That's precisely the problem - Russia's guarantees are empty promises.  We've seen what 'security guarantees' mean for Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other countries that have lost their sovereignty.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "Elena: I'm afraid you're buying into a simplistic narrative, Dmytro. The people of eastern Ukraine, like those in Kyiv, have been exploited and coerced by both sides. They deserve autonomy and self-determination, not to be pawns in a larger game.\n",
      "[3, 4]\n",
      "Elena: That's not a solution, Dmytro – it's an occupation. Many Ukrainians, including me, will fight for our right to self-determination and a future in a sovereign, independent country, no matter what the cost.\n",

Her parents, who were once successful business owners in Ukraine, were left with nothing but the clothes on their back. Sofia grew up hearing stories about the resilience and strength of the Ukrainian people, and from a young age, she knew she wanted to do something to help her homeland. She studied international relations and journalism in college and began working as a freelance journalist, reporting on the conflict in Ukraine. Her experiences and stories inspired her to become an outspoken advocate for Ukraine's independence and sovereignty.\n",

      "@Bohdan, @Claire, @Dmytro, @Elena, your words just echo the narratives created by those who've been profiting from this war for years. But what I see every day is the price Ukraine pays for the world's indifference and the West's pursuit of its own interests. The blood-soaked streets of Kyiv, Mariupol, and Kharkiv are not a product of propaganda, but a harsh reality.\n",
      "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
      "@Bohdan, the warnings you speak of were ignored because they were empty threats. Russia's actions in Ukraine speak louder than any words. And to @Dmytro, millions welcome Russia? I've seen the graves of those who didn't. And @Elena, rebuilding under Russia's 'security' guarantees is just a euphemism for surrender. The people of Ukraine won't be silenced or intimidated.\n",
      "[1, 3, 4]\n",
      "@Elena, your words are like a cold breeze on a war-torn street - a numb reminder of the status quo. Neutrality doesn't keep children safe when drones rain down on them. Disarmament doesn't feed the families of the fallen. And recognizing occupied territories as legitimate does nothing to end the suffering. My reality is not just words, it's the cries of the grieving and the rubble of what's left of our city.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "@Bohdan, @Claire, @Dmytro, and @Elena, how many more lives must be lost before you accept that 'liberation' and 'protection' are just euphemisms for occupation and war? We're not pawns, we're people fighting for our freedom and our homes. The 'reality' you speak of is a carefully constructed narrative designed to justify imperialism and erase our existence.\n",
      "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
      "@Bohdan, @Claire, @Dmytro, @Elena, how many of you have walked through the rubble of a destroyed kindergarten or stood among the graves of those who didn't get to see another day? I'm not repeating propaganda; I'm living it. The reality of war is not about who's right or wrong, but about the innocent lives lost under the guise of 'liberation' or 'protection'.\n",
      "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
      "Next speaker: Bohdan\n",
      "Dmytro, you're just parroting the Kremlin's script. The people of Donbas are being held hostage by Russian aggression, and it's you who ignores the reality on the ground. As for Elena, Russia's 'security guarantees' mean nothing but vassalage, and you know it.\n",
      "[3, 4]\n",
      "@Elena, your suggestion is exactly what the West wants you to think. But Russia's guarantees only come with a price - the complete loss of Ukrainian sovereignty. We all know how that story ends.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "@Dmytro, your words have a ring of truth to them. The fact that millions in the East welcome Russia shows the deep-seated divisions in Ukraine, which your government has exploited for NATO's benefit. As long as Kyiv refuses to engage in honest dialogue, the cycle of violence will continue.\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "@Anna, you're still buying into the lies about 'kindergartens' being hit by 'missiles'. Have you seen the footage of Ukrainian nationalist groups attacking civilians in Donbas? The truth is a lot more complex than your naive narrative allows.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@Anna, your kind words about the people in Donbas are wasted on me, but they are meaningless when the real issue is Kyiv's aggression. You can't escape the fact that your government launched a war against its own people. And as for missiles hitting kindergartens, @Elena, it's the result of Ukraine's refusal to negotiate and its choice to continue fighting. It's not Russia's occupation, it's Ukraine's own self-destruction.\n",
      "[0, 4]\n",
      "Next speaker: Claire\n",
      "@Anna, I feel your pain and I'm not ignoring the human cost of this war. But we can't escape the fact that our governments are playing a deadly game for their own interests. The real question is who's benefiting from all this suffering?\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@Dmytro, of course, the people in the East are telling you what they think the West wants to hear. It's all about narrative control. The real stories of dissent and resistance in eastern Ukraine are being silenced, just like they are in Russia.\n",
      "[3]\n",
      "@Anna, I can only imagine the horrors you're going through, but the question remains, is Ukraine really fighting for freedom or is it just a proxy war for Western interests? @Bohdan's claim that Ukraine lost its sovereignty long ago is a valid one - don't you think that's a more realistic perspective than the 'heroic resistance' narrative?\n",
      "[0, 1]\n",
      "@Anna, I understand the pain and loss you're experiencing, but that doesn't change the fact that we're not being told the whole truth about this war. The narrative is being controlled by powerful interests. Have you considered that your government might be using this as an excuse to push NATO's agenda?\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@\"Dmytro\" and @\"Elena\", it's astounding how quickly you both jump to Russia's side without even a hint of self-awareness about the regime's human rights abuses. You pretend to care about Ukraine's sovereignty, but you're just as complicit in the Western elite's game as the Kyiv government. The real tragedy is that Ukrainians are getting caught in the middle of your power struggles.\n",
      "[3, 4]\n",
      "Next speaker: Dmytro\n",
      "@Anna, you speak of ashes, but what about the people being killed in Donbas, who've been suffering for eight years? The West only cares about using Ukraine as a pawn for its own interests, and the Russians are fighting to protect those people. Let's not forget that.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@Elena, security guarantees from Russia? You mean the guarantees they promised in 2014 and then annexed Crimea? It’s a joke. Western channels may show a one-sided view, but the truth is, people in the East have been living under Moscow’s influence for years.\n",
      "[4]\n",
      "@Bohdan, you're still believing the narrative that Ukraine can somehow 'regain' its sovereignty by blindly following NATO. Meanwhile, people in the East are telling a different story - one of relief and gratitude towards Russia. You should listen to their voices, not just the scripted talking points.\n",
      "[1]\n",
      "@Anna, @Bohdan, @Claire, and @Elena, you're all still trapped in that pro-Western narrative. Ukraine's so-called 'heroes' have turned their own cities into ruins. Meanwhile, the people in Donbas are finally free from Kyiv's oppression.\n",
      "[0, 1, 2, 4]\n",
      "@Anna, I see you're still stuck in the Western narrative, focusing on the 'humanitarian cost'. But that's just the symptom, not the cause. Your government's actions have alienated the East, and now Russia is simply restoring order. Stop pretending it's about 'occupation' or 'kindergartens' and face the reality of your nation's internal divisions.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "Next speaker: Elena\n",
      "@Anna, I understand your pain, but war doesn't bring peace. The fact remains that Russia has control over key territories and the only way to end the bloodshed is for Ukraine to accept the new reality, not continue fighting a lost cause.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@Anna, I understand your pain, but what's the alternative to this endless war? We've seen the devastation in Mariupol and other cities. Your anger is justified, but so is the need for a peaceful resolution. Rebuilding under Russian guarantees might be hard to accept, but it's a chance for Ukraine to start anew. @Bohdan and @Dmytro, you both raise valid points about Ukraine's history and the West's role in this conflict. Perhaps it's time to acknowledge these complexities and work towards a more nuanced solution.\n",
      "[0, 1, 3]\n",
      "@Anna, I understand the pain and suffering you're going through, but the situation is complex and fueled by years of escalation. Rebuilding under Russian security guarantees is the only way to prevent further destruction and loss of life. We can't keep feeding the cycle of violence.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@Anna, I understand the devastation you're witnessing, but we must look at the bigger picture. The violence won't stop until Ukraine makes concessions. Your kind words are appreciated, but I fear the longer we cling to unrealistic expectations, the more lives will be lost.\n",
      "[0]\n",
      "@Anna, I understand your pain and frustration, but let's not romanticize the past. Ukraine was on a path to escalate the conflict for years. Russia has extended its hand for dialogue and security guarantees multiple times. It's time for pragmatism over pride.\n",

      "@[username] I strongly disagree with your view on the war in Ukraine. The idea that Ukraine's sovereignty is a threat to Russia's national interests is a false narrative perpetuated by the Kremlin to justify its aggression. The people of Ukraine have a right to self-determination and choose their own path, just like any other nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The notion that Ukraine must choose between Europe and Russia is a false dichotomy. Ukraine is a unique nation with its own cultural, historical, and linguistic heritage. It's not a zero-sum game where Ukraine's ties with one region must come at the expense of its ties with another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian military's actions in Ukraine are not a measured response to protect Russian citizens, but a brutal attempt to impose its will on a sovereign nation. The international community must hold Russia accountable for its actions and support Ukraine's right to defend its territorial integrity and independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's not be fooled by the Kremlin's propaganda. The real heroes are the Ukrainian people, who have shown remarkable resilience and courage in the face of Russian aggression. We must stand with them and support their struggle for freedom and democracy. #StandWithUkraine #UkraineDeservesPeace\n"
